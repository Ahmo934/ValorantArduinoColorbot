# DISCLAIMER:
- Only Leonardo R3 (ATmega32U4) compatible.
- You need to spoof your arduino using [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1153472800221298740/1153884234600169502/ArduinoSpoofer.exe) for it to work.

# Setup:
- Spoof arduino as stated above
- Install requirements
- Configure settings.ini (don't change valorantSensitivity value: optional, but recommended)
- Run main.py
- Change your Ingame Sensitivity to 0.4 (optional, but recommended)
- Change Enemy Highlight Color to Purple in Valorant
- Change Display Mode to Windowed Fullscreen (The colorbot tends to not work sometimes with fullscreen)
- Happy cheating :)
